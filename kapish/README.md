## Help received:
The only real outside help I received was from the tutorial linked by Yvonne (https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/).

## Other info
The only things that feel worthy of a mention here are that I implemented the history functionality and included a solid test suite for it as well.
